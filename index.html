        <h1>How to help the environment:</h1>
        <p>Charity begins at home. You can start contributing from home also, and then increase your contributions. Although we should consider the whole earth as our home, but we can at least start from our very own area i.e. a smaller boundary and then we should target a broader area contribution.

 <b>Keep your garden or greenspace chemical free </b><br>
Cut down on your use of herbicides and pesticides. These chemicals kill butterflies, moths and other pollinating insects, such as ladybirds, beetles and spiders – the natural enemies of your garden pests.

        <p><b>Don’t buy single-use plastics</b> <br>
Pop a flask or reusable bottle in your bag next time you are out and about. More than 2,600 plastic bottles a year would be stopped from entering our environment altogether if just 50 people packed a flask instead of buying a bottle. Small changes can make a big difference.

<b>Reduce your carbon footprint</b><br>
Even the smallest effort to reduce your carbon footprint can make a difference. On short journeys why not ditch the car in favour of walking or cycling, could you car share with a colleague to get to work or use public transport instead?
 <br><br>
 <b>Inspire others</b><br>
Helping to save butterflies, moths and other wildlife can be fun whether you are five or 105. Share your love of the natural world with those around you, encourage your family and friends to take part in outdoor activities.
Encouraging others to see the value and beauty of nature and its wildlife may be the most important way to help save it.

Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases and cancer, among other problems and diseases. Water pollution can lead to typhoid, diarrheal diseases, and another one. The local authorities have to promote care the environment.
